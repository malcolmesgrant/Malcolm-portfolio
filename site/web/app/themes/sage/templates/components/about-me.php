    <p>I learned early, that trial and error was part of the creative process and if I wanted to be unique I would have try... And try.... And try... And try again... 
    As a trend-setter I'm always looking for new things to create or make my own, and web-development gives me the tools to the creative freedom I seek.The first time I made a Task List with javaScript I fell in love. So I expanded my skill set, with semantically structured HTML5, CSS, and an understanding of seperation of concerns and progressive enhancement in user interface development. These skills allow me to work effectively with teams and provide me with the power to create at will.
